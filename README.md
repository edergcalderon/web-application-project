# web_applications
 building web applications using Django web framework

## spec
- We'll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to log the topics they're interested in and to make journal entries as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page will describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read and edit exisint entries.





 We'll write a specification for this project, and then we'll define models for the data the app will work with. We'll use Django's admin system to enter some initial data, and then you'll learn to write views and templates so Django can build the site's pages.

 Django can respond to page requests and make it easier to read and wwrite to a database, manage users, and muich more. In Chapters 19 and 20, you'll refine the Learning Log project and then deploy it to a live server so you (and your friends) can use it.
